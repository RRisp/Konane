# Konane

Our program plays Konane on the CSE 4705 server using minimax with a heuristic that we developed.

# RUN:
* To run the program simple write python3 konane_driver.py into the command line.
* After this follow to prompts to connect to the server using your team number, password, and opponent team number.

* The game will then be played by the two machines printing the board every turn, and the winner will be printed out on the command line by our program and the server.
